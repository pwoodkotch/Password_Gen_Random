# EZ Use Random Passcode Generator

##Descripton

Coming up with a new password is always a hassle in the digital age where most things websites and products require people to have passwords for access, and these passwords must be changed on some occassions!! This application aims to provide the user with a passcode that was randomly generated using criteria, specified by the user, in a series of prompts. Being built to provide the user with an easy way to create a new random password, the struggle of sitting there thinking of a new complex password everytime you have to change it is taken care of. This application has opened my eyes to the basic yet complex nature of javascript and everything that goes into making a simple application.

##Installation

$All the user must do is plug the url given into their web browser.

##Usage

$After typing in the url the user must click the generate password button at the bottom of the form.

$The user should then answer the prompts for character choice by clicking "ok" to add the option or "cancel" to leave that option out.

$When given the choice of length input a number between 8 and 128 otherwise the program will tell the user to refresh and start again.

$After answering all the prompts the application will then generate a passcode based on the user's inputs.

$All the user has to do from there is look at the box above the button to see their randomly generated passcode.

##Tests

$Click "ok" on the uppercase and special characters prompts, and "cancel" on the lowercase and numbers prompts, with any number for the length prompt. This should result in a passcode with only special characters and uppercase letters in it, as long as your desired length was.

$Now try the opposite click "ok" for lowercase and numbers, and "cancel" on uppercase and special characters. The user should then see a passcode generated to your desired length with only lowercase letters and numbers.
